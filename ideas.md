# Do no harm

## Ideas

### Bad devil

You are little devil. Always trying to do bad things, but you are not very good at it!

- You should not do any harm as you won't get any soul
- You should punish bad people, so they won't do any harm

### Cooking

You are a chef. You need to cook dishes for clients but be aware of their allergies! Also where to sit them as them may be sick or allergic to each other.

### Story Teller like "11 minutes"

In a story you need to figure out what effects what and finish the game without harming anyone.
More like puzzle game.

### Secret Agents

Like in the animated movie with Will Smith as pigeon. Everyone are creating deadly guns. You are trying to create safe things so that no one gets hurt.

### Doctor

You are a doctor. You need to cure people. But you need to be careful as you may harm them

### "Nature's Balance"

Like ECO game. You need to balance the ecosystem. You can't do any harm to it.

"Develop a game set in a vibrant and magical forest, where players must restore balance to the ecosystem. They can interact with different creatures and elements, using their abilities to nurture and protect the environment without disrupting its delicate harmony"

### "Demolition"

Like "Mages vs Goblins" or "Angry birds". You demolish buildings, but you need to be careful not to harm people or environment.

Even better: top down 2D. You control a crane with wrecking ball. You need to demolish buildings, but you need to be careful not to harm people or environment. (trees, animals, etc.). You can also use wrecking ball to move objects around. Pedestrians walk around and you need to be careful not to harm them.

There can be bosses and different type of event. Like Godzilla. Poop Monster. THE WORM.
Can have extra mods.

Game can have progression. You can unlock new levels, new buildings, new bosses, new mods. For destroying building fast enough you are paid. You can use money to buy new stuff.
Plot twist: some dirty politician can ask you to create "accidents" or demolish Hospitals, Schools, kindergartens, etc.

You control your crane with mouse. You can move it around and you can swing wrecking ball. You can also use mods. Like magnet, rocket, etc.

One of the mechanics can be careful driving. When you turn - wrecking ball swings. So you need to be careful not to hit anything (or hit on purpose). There can be timer and traffic.

### "Electrician"

As electrician you need to fix the wiring. But the wiring is to convoluted and you need to be careful not to harm yourself and it's also connected to other things, rooms, devices. Maybe you are in hospital and accidentally turn off life support. (Like Rick and Morty episode where Morty turned wrong switch and killed a lot of people)

### "Guardian (Angel)"

As an invisible guardian angel of specific person you need to protect him (and others) from harm.
By clicking and manipulating objects your goal is to prevent possible harm from happening and also to cause more harm.

## Extra ideas

- Game can have plot twist where player finds out that the stuff he was doing was actually bad and he was harming everyone. Like in REW - you fought humans all along, not aliens.

## Possible game mechanics

- Balancing/Strategy. Like city builder, resource management, etc.
- Puzzle. Point and click. Manipulating objects. Timing.
- Story. Choices. Plot twists.
- Turn based. REW. XCOM. (Unlikely)
